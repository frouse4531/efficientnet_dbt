# DBT_Net
Pytorch version of model in NeurIPS'19 paper "Learning Deep Bilinear Transformation for Fine-grained Image Representation"
  the code is transformed from the â€˜https://github.com/researchmm/DBTNet.
  
  Current work based on initial pytorch implementation that can be found in https://github.com/wuwusky/DBT_Net
